  - Supports scalable and secure database solutions.
- **GitHub**:
  - Version control and code repository.
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline automation.

#### **2. Testing Tools**
- **Unit Testing Frameworks**:
  - Dart and Flutterâ€™s built-in testing tools for unit, widget, and integration testing.
- **Load Testing Tools**:
  - Locust or JMeter for performance and stress testing.
- **User Testing Platforms**:
  - UserTesting.com or similar tools for gathering usability feedback from real users.

#### **3. Deployment Tools**
- **GitHub Actions**:
  - Automated testing and deployment pipelines.
  - Supports integration with hosting platforms.
- **Hosting Options**:
  - Supabase for database hosting.
  - Firebase or AWS for application hosting (pending decision).

#### **4. Team Collaboration Tools**

### **Outstanding Questions and Decisions**

#### **1. AI Integration**
- What specific AI services will be used for reminders and motivational prompts?
- Should the AI processing be fully remote, or is partial offline capability required?

#### **2. Hosting and Scalability**
- Will Firebase, AWS, or another hosting solution be used for the main application?
- Are there regional hosting requirements for GDPR or other compliance needs?

#### **3. Testing Strategy**
- How will user testing be conducted for both social worker and client interfaces?
- Will load testing tools like Locust be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?

#### **4. Security and Compliance Tools**
- Are there preferred tools for ongoing compliance audits?
- What tools will be used for real-time monitoring of data breaches and security incidents?

#### **5. Tool Set Gaps**
- Are there additional tools needed for monitoring, logging, or debugging?
- Would a dedicated analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics or Mixpanel) benefit the project?

### **Next Steps**
1. Finalize hosting platform based on scalability and compliance needs.
2. Validate testing tool compatibility with FlutterFlow and Supabase.
3. Select AI services for integration and define their role in the app.
4. Address outstanding questions in collaboration with stakeholders.
