#### **Objective**
This document outlines the security architecture, compliance measures, and implementation strategies for the Social Worker and Client Support App to ensure data protection and system integrity.

---

### **Key Compliance Standards**

#### **1. GDPR (EU)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Data minimization and anonymization.
  - Right to access, rectify, and erase personal data.
  - Breach notification within 72 hours.

#### **2. CCPA (California)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Transparency in data collection and usage.
  - Opt-out capability for data sharing.
  - Secure handling of personal information.

#### **3. HIPAA (US)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Protection of health-related data.
  - Access controls and encryption.
  - Audit logs for data access and modifications.

---

### **Security Measures**

#### **1. Data Encryption**
- **In Transit**:
  - HTTPS with TLS 1.3 for all communications.
- **At Rest**:
  - AES-256 encryption for database storage.

#### **2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Granular permissions for Clients, Social Workers, and Admins.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive roles (e.g., Admins).

#### **3. Anonymization and Pseudonymization**
- Replace identifiable data with unique hashes for analytics.
- Use pseudonymized data for internal testing and reporting.

#### **4. Offline Features**
- Encrypt locally stored data using platform-native encryption libraries.
- Sync data securely upon reconnection.

#### **5. Breach Notification System**
- Real-time monitoring and alerts for unauthorized access.
- Predefined workflows for notifying affected users and regulators.

---

### **Implementation Strategy**

#### **1. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
- Conduct security reviews at each development phase.
- Use automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP).

#### **2. Data Protection Tools**
- Use libraries and frameworks with built-in security features (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- Implement data masking for sensitive information displayed in the UI.

#### **3. Compliance Audits**
- Regular third-party audits for GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA compliance.
- Internal reviews using compliance checklists.

---

### **Workflows**

#### **1. Breach Detection and Response Workflow**
1. The system detects unauthorized access through monitoring tools.
2. Admins are notified in real time.
3. Investigate and isolate the breach.
4. Notify affected users and regulators within required timelines.

#### **2. Data Access Request Workflow**
1. A user submits a request to access their data.
2. The admin verifies the userâ€™s identity.
3. Export data in a readable, secure format and deliver it to the user.

#### **3. Role Assignment Workflow**
1. Admin creates a new user account.
2. Assigns a role with predefined permissions.
3. Enables MFA for roles with sensitive access.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Validate encryption and anonymization methods with security experts.
- Develop automated compliance tools for audits and reporting.
- Implement and test breach detection workflows.
