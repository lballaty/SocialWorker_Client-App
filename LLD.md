3.	Use the messaging feature to communicate action plans with clients.
4.	Create or modify tasks using templates, recurrence, and propagation settings.
5.	Approve or discuss client-suggested task changes.
Client Workflow
1.	Open the app to view daily tasks with checkboxes.
2.	Mark completed tasks and receive rewards.
3.	Get reminders for upcoming tasks.
4.	Communicate with the assigned social worker for assistance.
5.	Suggest task changes for social worker approval (if enabled).
Admin Workflow
